# Data_Encryption_Standard
Java implementation of DES. Takes in both files and inputted text and produces an encryption/decryption (decided by user).

Works by taking in .txt or .dat files as plaintext (or manually inputted text) and a 16 character hexadecimal key in a .key file. The DES algorithm is then applied to the text and an output file is produced. Encryption and Decryption is selected by the user after uploading all necessary files.
